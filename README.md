# SpaceCalc
This app was made more or less for use with a CNC router cutting holes for pickets in Vinyl railing.
You enter in the different values and it calculates the required information for the cnc machine.
You can use the Rise/Run. This is for stairways. If you router holes in your railings for pickets, or you router holes into the
post for the railings,the holes will need to be elongated acording to the angle of Rise/Run. The calculator calculated the required
amount based on the Rise/Run, Material Dimension, and material thickness.
At its core, it can calculate the number of pickets needed and the proper spacing, for any given length, picket size, and to some extent picket spacing.
you tell it how much spacing you want, and it does its best to match that spacing with the given information.
The Stairway feature was added in because the two programs were essentially the same, so it seemed redundant to have two seperate tabe with 
basically the same information.

At some point I would like to add:

-saving of common size materials. the width and thicknes of the profile, not the length. Lenghts will be entered
in per job.

-saving of specific jobs to a log file, with customer name as filename.

-graphical representation of the railing. Using the drawing function with the output of the calculator as variables to display a representation of whats
being made.

-txt output of cnc gcode output.
